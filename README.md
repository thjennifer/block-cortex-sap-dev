<h2><span style="color:#2d7eea"> Required Parameters</span></h2>
> ⚠️ These required values are configured during the Marketplace Installation process, or if this Block was installed from a forked Git repository, you will update the values for these constants in the `manifest.lkml` file for the project.


| **Required Parameter** | **Label**                            | **Description** |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Connection Name** | Name of the connection      | The BigQuery connection name that allows Looker to query the Cortex REPORTING dataset.|
| **GCP Project ID** | Project ID  | The Google Cloud project where the reporting dataset resides in BigQuery. For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects).|
| **Reporting Dataset** | Name of the dataset for Cortex reporting | The deployed Cortex Data Framework REPORTING dataset where the SAP views reside within the Google Cloud BigQuery project. Depending on the deployment settings for the Cortex Data Framework, this dataset name would typically be of the pattern ending with _REPORTING.|
| **Client ID** | SAP Client number (MANDT) | The SAP Client number (mandt) to use for Reporting. |
| **Sign Change** | **Yes** or **No** | For Profit and Loss/Income Statement reporting, revenue is generally displayed in the general ledger as a negative number, which indicates a credit. By setting Sign Change value to **Yes**, it's displayed as a positive number in income statement reports.|

<h2><span style="color:#2d7eea">Persistent Derived Tables required</span></h2>

The BigQuery connection used for this block must have [Persistent Derived Tables](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/derived-tables#persistent_derived_tables) enabled. For more information, see [Enabling PDTs on a Connection](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/db-config-google-bigquery#creating_a_temporary_dataset_for_persistent_derived_tables).

<h2><span style="color:#2d7eea"> Required User Attributes</span></h2>

Some dashboards require Looker [user attributes](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-users-user-attributes) to work properly. User attributes provide a customized experience for each Looker user. A Looker administrator defines a user attribute and then applies a user attribute value to a user group or to individual users. For more information, see [Admin settings - User attributes](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-users-user-attributes).

For this Looker Block for SAP, a Looker Administrator should create the following user attributes and set the values **exactly** as follows:

| **Required User Attribute Name** | **Label**                            | **Description** | **Default Value** |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| cortex_sap_default_target_currency  | Cortex SAP: Default Target Currency  | Impacts the default target currency to display in dashboards. The provided dashboards allow users to switch currencies. | **USD** or desired currency like EUR, CAD or JPY |
| cortex_default_language_key                  | Cortex SAP: Default SAP Language Key | Manages the language displayed for descriptions such as customer name, distribution channel names, and product name. | Enter the desired SAP language key or **E** for English if using the provided test data |
| cortex_use_test_data | Cortex SAP: Use Test Data (Yes or No) | If set to **Yes**, current date is replaced with November 20, 2023 for calculations. This ensures accurate calculations for dimensions like age of receivables. | Enter **Yes** if using Cortex Framework test data. Otherwise, enter **No**. |
| cortex_sap_show_original_sap_field_name | Cortex SAP: Show original SAP field name in label (Yes or No) | If set to **Yes**, the original SAP code like MANDT or VBELN will be shown in the field label. | Enter preferred value, either **Yes** or **No**. |

For all of the user attributes, configure these properties as follows:
- **Data Type**: String
- **User Access**: Edit
- **Hide Value**: No

Each dashboard user can personalize these values by following the instructions in [Personalizing user account settings](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/user-account).


<h2><span style="color:#2d7eea">Other Considerations</span></h2>

- **Liquid Templating Language**: Some constants, views, explores and dashboard use liquid templating language. For more information, see Looker's [Liquid Variable Reference](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/liquid-variable-reference) documentation.

- **(Optional) Unhide additional dimensions and measures**: Many dimensions and measures are hidden for simplicity. If you find anything valuable missing, update the field's `hidden` parameter value to **No** in the relevant views.
